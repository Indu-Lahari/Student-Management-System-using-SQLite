# Build a SQLite Student Management System using PYQt

## Description

This project involves creating a Student Management System using SQLite for database management and PyQt for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to add, edit, search, and delete student records through an intuitive interface.

## Process

1. **Setup Environment**: 
   - Install Python and necessary libraries.
   - Set up PyQt for GUI development.
   - Prepare SQLite database.

2. **Design Interface**: 
   - Use PyQt to design the main window, including menus, toolbars, and status bars.
   - Create dialogs for adding, editing, searching, and deleting student records.

3. **Database Connection**: 
   - Establish connection to SQLite database.
   - Implement functions to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

4. **Implement Features**:
   - **Add Student**: Dialog to add new student records.
   - **Edit Student**: Dialog to update existing student records.
   - **Search Student**: Dialog to find and highlight student records.
   - **Delete Student**: Dialog to confirm and delete student records.

5. **Refactor Code**:
   - Refactor code to avoid duplication and improve readability.
   - Use classes and methods to organize functionality.

6. **Testing**: 
   - Test each feature to ensure it works as expected.
   - Handle potential errors and edge cases.

## Technology Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **PyQt**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **SQLite**: For managing the database.
- **PyCharm IDE**: For development and debugging.
- **Pandas**: For handling CSV files and data manipulation.

## What I Learned from This Project

- **GUI Development**: Learned to design and implement a graphical user interface using PyQt.
- **Database Management**: Gained experience with SQLite for database operations.
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved code quality by refactoring and avoiding duplication.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event handling for GUI components.
- **CRUD Operations**: Developed skills to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a database.

## Future Insights

- **Enhance UI/UX**: Improve the user interface for better user experience.
- **Advanced Search**: Implement more advanced search capabilities, such as filtering by different criteria.
- **Reporting**: Add functionality to generate reports based on student data.
- **User Authentication**: Integrate user authentication to restrict access to certain features.
- **Backup and Restore**: Implement backup and restore functionality for the database.
